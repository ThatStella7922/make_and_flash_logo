      - Implement basic preferences system
      - Allow skipping the check at the beginning of the script where you are
        asked to confirm that your Pinecil is connected in DFU mode
      - Prevent "no such file or directory" or "error reading image file" or
        "[Errno 2]" errors by asking user for file if not automatically found.
      - Apply fix to prevent "won't overwrite existing file" errors.
      - Use variables across more of the script

  • INSTRUCTION
    - Change name to INSTRUCTION from README. This was done to help prevent
      confusion between the repo's README.md and the README.txt.
