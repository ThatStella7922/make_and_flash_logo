make_and_flash_logo by ThatsNiceGuy - Script, INSTRUCTION and CHANGELOG Version 2.0
A bundle to convert and flash your logo to a Pinecil.

Requirements:
  - Windows 10 x64 PC
  - Python 3.x must be installed and callable via just 'python'
  - Pillow needs to be installed with Pip
  - Your Pinecil must be running IronOS
  - Your Pinecil needs to have the WinUSB driver installed
  - Compatible logo image

What is a compatible logo image:
  96x16 image with only black and white - No color.
  Black is recommended for the background color of your image.

  See example.png in the same directory as this README for an example
  or flash it to your Pinecil if you want.

How to put your Pinecil into DFU mode:
  While holding down the - button, plug it into your PC.
  The Pinecil's display will remain blank if you succesfully entered DFU.
  You can let go once you hear the 'device connected' sound from Windows.

Instructions:
  1. Installing Pillow (python 3 must be the default)
    a) pip install Pillow

  2. Installing the WinUSB driver-----------
  If you already did this, skip this part.
    a) Get Zadig from https://zadig.akeo.ie
    b) Connect your Pinecil in DFU mode
    b) Ensure Zadig shows a USB ID of 28e9 0189, then install the WinUSB driver.
    c) You should be done. If it fails, restart your PC and retry.


  3. Run the utility------------
    a) Connect your Pinecil in DFU mode if it isn't already connected.
    b) Run 'make_and_flash_logo.bat'. It's in the same folder as this README.
       If the script is unable to find a file called 'logo.png' in the same folder as the
       script, it will prompt you for the logo image.

       This will easily and quickly convert and flash a logo to your Pinecil in one click.

    Optional - skips the utility asking for imagep ath
    a) Place your logo image inside the same folder as this README file.
    b) Rename your logo image to logo.png if it isn't already called that.

    Other included scripts:
    - make_logo
      - This script will easily and quickly convert a logo to the Pinecil and TS100/TS80/TS80P formats
    - flash_logo 
      - This script will easily and quickly flash a converted logo to the Pinecil.


  4. Troubleshoot-----------
    a) "Cannot open DFU device 28e9:0189"
       Check that the WinUSB driver is installed for the Pinecil in Zadig.

       If the driver is already installed, try reconnecting your Pinecil
       (of course in DFU mode)

       You can also try waiting a few minutes until you hear Windows'
       'device unplugged' sound.
